# Family Name Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Family List - Names not visible after node selection**: When viewing a family member's details, Father, Mother, Spouse, and Children sections only showed serial numbers (IDs), not names.

2. **Dynamic Query Display**: Relationship data was showing incorrect field names and IDs instead of member names.

3. **Relationships Table**: Display was using wrong field names (`person1`, `person2`, `type` instead of `fromSerNo`, `toSerNo`, `relation`).

4. **Family Member Form**: Serial number inputs for Father, Mother, Spouse, and Children didn't show the associated member names.

## Changes Made to AdminDashboard.jsx

### 1. Added `getMemberName()` Function (Line 601-607)
```javascript
const getMemberName = (serNo) => {
  if (!serNo) return 'N/A';
  const member = familyMembers.find(m => m.serNo === Number(serNo));
  if (!member) return `SerNo: ${serNo}`;
  const personal = member.personalDetails || {};
  return member.fullName || `${personal.firstName || ''} ${personal.lastName || ''}`.trim() || `SerNo: ${serNo}`;
};
```
- Looks up family member name by serial number
- Displays "N/A" for empty values
- Falls back to "SerNo: X" if member not found
- Returns full formatted name with both firstName and lastName

### 2. Fixed Relationships Table (Lines 1374-1420)
**Before**: Displayed `item.person1`, `item.person2`, `item.type` (wrong field names)
**After**: 
- Uses correct field names: `fromSerNo`, `toSerNo`, `relation`
- Displays member names alongside serial numbers
- Shows full person information with name and SerNo on separate lines
- Example display:
  ```
  From Person: "John Doe" (SerNo: 5)
  To Person: "Jane Doe" (SerNo: 3)
  Relation: "father"
  ```

### 3. Fixed Relationships Form Modal (Lines 1685-1745)
**Before**: Used incorrect field names ("Person 1 ID", "Person 2 ID", "type")
**After**:
- "From Person (SerNo)" input + live name lookup below
- "To Person (SerNo)" input + live name lookup below
- "Relation" field (correctly mapped to API field)
- "Relation (Marathi)" for translation
- "Level" field for relationship level
- Each field shows the resolved member name as you type

### 4. Enhanced Family Member Form (Lines 1543-1625)
**Before**: Only showed serial number inputs
**After**: Shows names below each serial number:
- **Father SerNo**: Display shows "Father: {name}"
- **Mother SerNo**: Display shows "Mother: {name}"
- **Spouse SerNo**: Display shows "Spouse: {name}"
- **Children SerNos**: Displays "Children: • {name1} • {name2} ..."
  
Example:
```
Father SerNo: [5]
↓
Father: Ramesh Kumar Sharma (SerNo: 5)
```

### 5. Fixed Default Form Data (Lines 161-167)
- Relationship fields now convert numeric values to strings properly for form display
- Ensures consistent data handling between form and API

## Result
Users can now:
✅ See actual names when viewing family member details
✅ Identify related family members without memorizing serial numbers
✅ View relationship data with both names and serial numbers for verification
✅ Quickly verify correct person is selected when entering serial numbers
