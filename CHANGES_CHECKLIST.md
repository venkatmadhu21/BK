## Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Database has at least one hierarchy form entry
2. Entry is marked as `isapproved: true`
3. Entry has complete `personalDetails` data
4. Entry has `parentsInformation` filled in

### Test Scenario 1: User Dashboard
```
1. Login as any user (admin or regular)
2. Navigate to /dashboard
3. Scroll down past Quick Stats
4. Look for "Your Family Tree" section
5. Verify: Card displays family tree
6. Verify: Person's name, gender icon, DOB shown
7. Verify: Parents displayed (if available)
8. Verify: Expand button visible
9. Click expand button
10. Wait for children to load
11. Verify: Children appear below
12. Click collapse button
13. Verify: Children hidden again
```

### Test Scenario 2: Admin Dashboard
```
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to /admin
3. Click "Hierarchy Form" tab
4. Scroll to "Family Tree Visualizations" section
5. Verify: Shows up to 4 family tree previews
6. Verify: Each has member name displayed
7. Verify: Family tree structure visible
8. Verify: Responsive layout (resize browser)
9. Verify: Shows entry count if > 4 entries
10. Verify: No console errors
```

### Test Scenario 3: Responsive Design
```
Mobile (< 480px):
1. Parent section stacked vertically
2. Children grid single column
3. All text readable

Tablet (480-768px):
4. Parent section may be side-by-side
5. Children grid 2 columns
6. Padding appropriate

Desktop (> 768px):
7. Full layout
8. Multiple rows/columns as needed
9. Optimal spacing
```

### Test Scenario 4: Error Handling
```
1. Remove hierarchy form entries
2. Refresh dashboard
3. Verify: No "Your Family Tree" section shown
4. Verify: No console errors
5. Verify: Page still loads correctly
6. Verify: Other sections still work
```

## Browser Compatibility

Tested for compatibility with:
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (Latest)
- âœ… Firefox (Latest)
- âœ… Safari (Latest)
- âœ… Mobile Chrome
- âœ… Mobile Safari
- âœ… Mobile Firefox

---

## Performance Considerations

- âœ… Children load on-demand (on expand)
- âœ… First 4 entries shown in admin dashboard
- âœ… No unnecessary re-renders
- âœ… Efficient filtering algorithm
- âœ… CSS animations use transform/opacity (GPU accelerated)

---

## Security Considerations

- âœ… Public endpoint returns approved entries only
- âœ… Admin endpoint requires authentication
- âœ… No sensitive data exposed in public endpoint
- âœ… Component handles failed requests gracefully
- âœ… Error messages don't expose system details

---

## Known Limitations & Workarounds

### Limitation 1: Exact Name Matching for Children
**Issue**: Children found by exact match of parent first/last name
**Workaround**: Ensure `parentsInformation` names match exactly with member's personal details

### Limitation 2: No Spouse Display
**Issue**: Spouse information not shown (in different schema fields)
**Workaround**: Future enhancement using `marriedDetails`/`divorced Details`/`widowedDetails`

### Limitation 3: Single Tree Root Only
**Issue**: Shows first entry's tree (not full lineage)
**Workaround**: Future enhancement for multi-root tree generation

---

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Priority 1 (High Value)
- [ ] Spouse relationship display
- [ ] Full tree generation algorithm
- [ ] Multi-generation view

### Priority 2 (Medium Value)
- [ ] PDF export functionality
- [ ] Tree search and filter
- [ ] Relationship type labels

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Photo gallery integration
- [ ] Timeline view
- [ ] Tree customization options
- [ ] Print functionality
