## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **URL-based Photo Storage**: Uses existing image URLs instead of server upload
   - Pros: No server storage needed, works with Cloudinary/external hosts
   - Cons: Requires URL access, thumbnail URLs need to be provided

2. **Auto Album Creation**: Albums auto-create when event/news is created
   - Pros: Seamless user experience, no manual setup
   - Cons: Creates empty albums initially

3. **Pagination**: 20 photos per page by default
   - Pros: Better performance, cleaner UI
   - Cons: Requires user to navigate through pages

4. **Client-side Filtering**: All filtering happens on frontend via API
   - Pros: Responsive filtering, better UX
   - Cons: Requires more API calls for stats

5. **Separate Sidebar Component**: Filters in dedicated sidebar
   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns, easy to hide on mobile
   - Cons: Takes up horizontal space on desktop
