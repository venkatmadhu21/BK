## 🛑 Troubleshooting

### Issue: MongoDB not running
```
Error message: "MongoDB Connection Failed"
```
**Fix:**
```powershell
Start-Service MongoDB
```

### Issue: Still shows "Loading news and events..."
```
Scroller won't display data
```
**Fix:**
```powershell
# Make sure MongoDB is running
Get-Service MongoDB

# Add sample data
node add-test-events.js

# Restart the app (close both terminals and restart)
```

### Issue: Only News shows (no Events)
```
See blue cards but no purple cards
```
**Cause:** Events might be empty or have wrong status

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Re-run the add events script
node add-test-events.js

# Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
```

### Issue: Console shows errors
```
Red error messages in F12 Console
```
**Check:**
1. Is backend still running? (Check Terminal 1)
2. Is MongoDB still running? `Get-Service MongoDB`
3. Are you logged in? (Try logout/login)

### Issue: Need more help
```
Still not working after all steps
```
**Run diagnostics:**
```powershell
node diagnose-scroller.js
```

It will tell you exactly what's missing!
