## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Login still fails after password change"
→ Check both Users and LegacyLogin collections  
→ Admin can reset credentials to resync

### "Email not sent with new credentials"
→ Check Gmail configuration in .env  
→ Admin can manually share credentials from response

### "Non-admin can't access reset endpoint"
→ ✓ This is correct! Only admins can access it
