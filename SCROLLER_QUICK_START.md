## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `client/src/components/Scroller.jsx` - Enhanced component
2. `client/src/pages/News.jsx` - Fixed integration + sticky positioning
3. `client/src/pages/Events.jsx` - Fixed integration + sticky positioning

### Key Features
- **Smooth Animation**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**
   - News page fetches latest news articles and upcoming events
   - Events page fetches latest news and all events
   - Uses existing API endpoints

2. **Scroller Animation**
   - Component duplicates items: `[...items, ...items]`
   - Continuously moves scroll position
   - Resets seamlessly when items loop

3. **Pause/Resume**
   - Click button or hover over scroller
   - Updates `isPaused` state
   - Animation respects pause state

```javascript
const scrollSpeed = 0.8; // Change value (higher = faster)
```

### Change Number of Items
Edit News.jsx line 883 and Events.jsx line 1104:
```javascript
newsItems={newsData.slice(0, 5)}  // Change 5 to any number
eventItems={eventsData.slice(0, 5)}
```

### Custom Colors
Modify Tailwind classes in Scroller.jsx cards to change colors
