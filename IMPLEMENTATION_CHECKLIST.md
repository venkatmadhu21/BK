## ðŸ”„ How to Test

### 1. Test Family List Display
```
Steps:
1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Click on "Family Tree" tab
3. Verify family members are displayed
4. Check names, gender indicators, and other details are visible
5. Filter by gender/level/vansh - should work correctly
```

### 2. Test Individual Member Page
```
Steps:
1. Click on any family member from the list
2. Member details should load correctly
3. Verify personal info, dates, address display properly
4. Check parents and children sections load
```

### 3. Test Tree Visualizations
```
Steps:
1. Navigate to Family Tree page
2. Try different tree view options:
   - Simple tree view
   - Visual tree view
   - Comprehensive view (shows all generations)
   - Enhanced tree view
3. All should display members correctly
```

### 4. Test Filters
```
Steps:
1. On Family List page:
   - Filter by gender (Male/Female) - should work
   - Filter by level - should work
   - Filter by vansh - should work
   - Search by name - should work
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Family list not appearing
**Solution**: 
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for errors
3. Verify API endpoint returns data with correct schema
4. Ensure transformation is being called

### Issue: Gender icons showing incorrectly
**Solution**:
1. Check if gender field in database is lowercase/uppercase
2. Verify `isMale()` helper is being used
3. Check case-insensitive comparison is working

### Issue: Names appearing as [object Object]
**Solution**:
1. Check if `fullName` is being computed correctly
2. Verify `firstName`, `middleName`, `lastName` are accessible
3. Check transformation is mapping these fields

### Issue: Dates not formatting correctly
**Solution**:
1. Verify date fields are in ISO format
2. Check `formatDate()` function is being called
3. Ensure transformation is preserving date values

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Considerations

### Optional Future Improvements
- [ ] Add data validation in transformation utility
- [ ] Add error logging for transformation failures
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for transformation
- [ ] Create unit tests for transformation functions
- [ ] Consider adding data caching layer

### Backend Considerations
- Ensure all API endpoints return data in the new schema consistently
- Consider adding a schema validation middleware
- Ensure `/api/family/members` returns all fields properly
