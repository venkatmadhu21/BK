## 🔍 Verify It's Working

### Check 1: Browser Console (F12)
Should show:
```
✅ 📰 Fetched News: Array(3)
✅ 📅 Fetched Events: Array(3)
✅ 🔍 Scroller Debug - News Items: 3, Event Items: 3, Combined: 6
```

### Check 2: Visual Display
- ✅ Blue cards with 📰 NEWS badge = News items
- ✅ Purple cards with 📅 EVENT badge = Event items
- ✅ Mixed together in one scroller
- ✅ Auto-scrolling horizontally
- ✅ Can pause/play with button

### Check 3: Card Content
Each card should show:
- Title (from database)
- Description/Content (from database)
- Date (from database)
- No blank fields

---

## 🆘 If It Doesn't Work

### Problem: "Still showing Loading..."

**Fix:**
```powershell
# 1. Make sure MongoDB is running
Get-Service MongoDB
# Should show: Status: Running

# 2. If stopped, start it
Start-Service MongoDB

# 3. Check what's in database
node diagnose-scroller.js
# Should show: Published News > 0, Upcoming Events > 0

# 4. If counts are 0, add data
node add-test-events.js

# 5. Restart the app
# Kill Terminal 1 (backend)
# Kill Terminal 2 (frontend)
# Then restart Commands 5 & 6 above
```

### Problem: Only News shows, no Events

**Cause:** Events need `status: 'Upcoming'` to appear

**Fix:**
```powershell
node add-test-events.js
```
This creates 3 sample events with correct status.

### Problem: Console shows API errors

**Check:** Are you logged in?
- Must be logged in for API to work
- Try: Log out, then log in again

**Check:** Is MongoDB running?
```powershell
Get-Service MongoDB
```
If "Stopped":
```powershell
Start-Service MongoDB
```

## 📊 What Was Fixed?

The fix was simple - two field name errors in the Scroller component:

```javascript
// WRONG ❌
item.publishedDate    // News has "publishDate" not "publishedDate"
item.description      // News has "content" not "description"

// CORRECT ✅
item.publishDate
item.content (for news)
item.description (for events)
```

That's it! Everything else was already working.

## 📋 Checklist

## 💡 Understanding the Setup

### Before (Broken ❌)
Scroller tried to access wrong field names → no data displayed

### After (Fixed ✅)
Scroller accesses correct field names → both news & events display!

### What Changed
- Fixed News date field: `publishedDate` → `publishDate`
- Fixed News content field: added logic to use `content` for news
- Everything else already correct!

### What's Showing Now
- **News Cards (Blue):** Shows `title`, `content`, `publishDate`
- **Event Cards (Purple):** Shows `title`, `description`, `startDate`
